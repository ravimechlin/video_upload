"In this project, we aim to delve into Docker concepts, Cloud computing concepts, and Single Sign-On (SSO). Presently, the project is in its development phase.

To begin, please locate the 'video_upload' directory. Subsequently, perform 'docker-compose build' to construct the image. Once the image is successfully built, initiate 'docker-compose up'. After the services, encompassing web services and the PostgreSQL database, have started and are operational, you will be able to access the local server."
